            <p>
                <em>Uncommonsessions</em> is a neighborhood for channeling a pluriverse discourse. A digital space designed and conceptualized by PING with Nick Reilly, rooted in the Disarming Design from Palestine network. It engages with cross-educational models and operates at the intersection of design, tools, open-source and politics. <em>Uncommonsessions</em> collaborates with design schools to shape collective methods of mutual learning and exchange, developing context specific vocabularies, ideas and common projects. We aim to explore and expand design practices for solidarity, social transformation and political action.
                </p>
                <p>
                Uncommonsessions is an experimental space for collaborative production
                </p>
                <p>
                A session is hosted by selecting one of the three different channels: Image, Voice and Words.
                </p>
                <p>
                Each channel presents a different format inviting participants to engage through a common tool in an uncommon way of using it. Because each one of them was designed with a restrictive function, collaboration becomes the only way of achieving a successful outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                A session is only active when at least one participant is present in it. To produce complete content and get it saved you need the others.
                </p>
                <p>
                No content or data is recorded or archived, thus Eeach session is a moment in time,. aAn immediate temporary space. A dislocated and descentralited library.
                </p>
                <p>
                The content between participants is being shared by using a temporary memory enabled by WebSockets. WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                The session will be saved only in the cache of the computer in use. If the cache is cleaned, the session will be lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                The only way to permanently save the results of the session is by screenshots or external audio/image recording apps.
                </p>
                <h1><strong>Code of conduct</strong></h1>
                
                
                <p>
                <em>UncommonSessions</em> is a learning environment where possible futures, fearless collectivities and desired technologies can be experimented. 
                </p>
                <p>
                We strive to create a safen environment for participants where complex topics can be shared and discussed. Our positioning is one of risk-taking and trial and error in which rigor and critique meet with humor, insecurity, tension, ambiguity and mistakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                We use Free, Libre and Open Source software whenever possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                <em>UncommonSessions</em> is a collective setting where people feel safe and comfortable to express themselves, learn and collaborate. We hope that everyone who participates in <em>UncommonSessions</em> is respectful and takes care of each other. In the interest of creating an inclusive environment, we do not tolerate sexism, racism, queer antagonism, ableism and other kinds of oppression.

                No session is saved or archived in any database or server. In fact, this website is not using any database.

                <p>
                The only way to permanently save the results of the session is by screenshots or external audio/image recording apps.captions.

                <p>
                In thethis sound channelboard one minute clips can be recorded. Participants are visible to each other by their computer cursor. A blinking cursor indicates a recording taking place. Multiple recordings can be happening at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                Participants can choose a position on the screen for the sound clip to appear. 
                </p>
                <p>
                By clicking the ComposePlay Button all clips get automatically organized chronologically by the time they were recorded, creating an unexpected composition. Press Play button to linearly play them all togheter.
                </p>
                <p>
                A session is only active when at least one participant is present in it.

                <p>
                No content or data is recorded or archived, thus each session is a moment in time. An immediate temporary space.
